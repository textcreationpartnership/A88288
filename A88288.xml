            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>The nobility, the rich and great ones about these times are like to be sick by reason of ill and unwholsome blasts of wind, anglic<seg rend="sup">Ã¨</seg> the breath of the people, cry for vengeance upon them, and by reason of earthquakes and unsavory fumosities of the earth, and by reason of warre and complaints betwixt the rich man, and the poore man: the hatred of the people begins sooner against their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors then otherwise it would, and coutinues more fiercely: many of quality will be committed, authority finding how much they have been cheated and couzned by Members of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:164852:3"/> their own; It is for money, and robbing the Common-Wealth that many have the sentence of condemnation.</p>
            <p>Absolutely the souldier or sword is rampart this year, or either gives Lawes or straines hard for it, to settle the Kingdome in a very judicious posture, not wronging the civill Magistrate or the just Lawes of the Kingdome, but regulates their exorbitancies; let no mans heart faile, the work of God is going forward.</p>
            <p>Doubtlesse the materiall effects of the great Eclipse hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this yeare, which shall concern England, they will principally be effected in London and Westminster, this I mean as unto the Body politique.

Fines and mulcts of money in a large measure are foreseen from hence to be levied out of the estates of Mallefactors, but some of principall quality I feare must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of their fellowes in mischief, and become either heedlesse or die otherwise, according to the quality of their Oaths and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: This year emergent occasions will rise in Ireland, and that Kingdome doth swell; nor is it evident unto meâ–ª but that this year, the most noble house of Austria will again be near unto some domestick broiles, I mean the Emperor of Germany may greatly distrust some secret plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to disturb his little quiet, the person of the King of Spain is much subject to receive preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice by this Eclipse; but thou noble branch of the Austrian house be sure it is the fore-runner of sedition, and some treacherous designe against thy happinesse; I fear a mutiny of thy Subjects, during the effects of this Eclipse.</p>
            <p>The industrious Venetian is much concerned in this Eclipse, but alas there is a configuration
